<p><font face="broadway" size="8" color="white">Islam is my Religion,</font></p><font face="Bookman old style" color="white" size="5"><p>Islam… is the best thing that has happened to me. Some may view it as just another religion, but for a practicing Muslim it is as indispensable as oxygen.</p><font face="forte" size="10" color="white"><p></font></p><p><font face="Bookman old style" size="5" color="white">I believe Islam is a wholesome religion. Along with convincing each individual, this system also talks elaborately on interpersonal relationships: how to treat your parents, your spouse, your relatives, your neighbours, etc. Islam encourages one to be equally thoughtful about other sections of society, namely, orphans, widows, needy, animals, etc.</p>
